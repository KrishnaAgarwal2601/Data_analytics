        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- In Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using classes and objects. It allows you to model real-world entities using attributes (data) and methods (functions). Key concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction and encapsulation are both key concepts in object-oriented programming. Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex details and showing only the necessary parts of an object, making the interface simpler for the user. Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data. While abstraction deals with design, encapsulation is more about implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods in Python (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores, like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__len__`. They enable custom behavior for built-in operations, such as object creation, printing, or operator overloading. For example, `__init__` initializes an object, and `__str__` defines its string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance in OOP is a concept where a class (called a child or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called a parent or superclass). This allows code reuse and makes it easier to build and maintain programs. The child class can also have its own additional features or override the inherited ones to modify behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in OOP means the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or function in different ways. It allows methods to be used interchangeably across different classes, making code more flexible and extensible. For example, different classes can have a method with the same name, but each class implements it differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods within a class and controlling access using access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that automatically runs when a new object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object’s attributes with values. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:  \n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):  \n",
        "        self.name = name  \n",
        "        self.age = age  \n",
        "Here, __init__ sets the initial values of name and age when a Person object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- In Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Class methods** (using @classmethod) take cls as the first argument and can access or modify class state. They are called on the class, not instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Static methods** (using @staticmethod) take no self or cls and cannot access class or instance data. They're utility functions grouped with the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. It can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length arguments (`*args`, `**args`) in a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class, allowing the subclass to customize or replace the behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The property decorator in Python is used to define a getter method that allows a class method to be accessed like an attribute. It is commonly used to encapsulate data and add controlled access to class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface, enabling flexible, reusable, and extensible code. It supports method overriding and dynamic behavior, making programs easier to maintain and extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and usually contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. It's defined using the `ABC` module to provide a common interface for related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- **Advantages of OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming) include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Modularity**: Code is organized into classes and objects.\n",
        "* **Reusability**: Code can be reused through inheritance.\n",
        "* **Maintainability**: Easier to update and manage.\n",
        "* **Encapsulation**: Protects data by restricting direct access.\n",
        "* **Polymorphism**: Enables flexible and interchangeable use of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- A class variable is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class variable**: Defined inside the class but outside any method.\n",
        "* **Instance variable**: Defined inside a method, typically within `__init__`, using `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining their features and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "- The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python are used to define string representations of objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__str__`: Returns a user-friendly string, used by `print()` and `str()`.\n",
        "* `__repr__`: Returns an unambiguous string for developers, used by `repr()` and in the Python shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return \"Person object\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __repr__(self):\n",
        "        return \"Person(name='John')\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class. It is commonly used in inheritance to access and extend the behavior of the parent class without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected). It's used to perform cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python is:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **@staticmethod:** Does not take self or cls as a parameter. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **@classmethod:** Takes cls as the first parameter and can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows different subclasses to define their own versions of a method defined in a common base class, and enables using those objects interchangeably.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after the other. This works by having each method return self, allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. It lets you define custom behavior when the object is \"called.\"\n",
